## Objective:
The objective of this hand-on project-based exercise is to practice how to create a full-stack web app (a Layered Software Architecture) using the MERN stack. The MERN stack is MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js. The students will also learn how to use MongoDB Realm to convert the backend to "serverless" and host the entire thing in the cloud. You will also practice how to host the React frontend for free in the cloud.

## Instruction:
The students study and practice by following along with the video link below. Beware that you may need to solve several related technical issues, e.g. version compatibility issues. The students are encouraged to learn and practice more by yourselves about coding in HTML, CSS, and Javascript for both frond-end and back-end parts, e.g. referring to other resources, as best as you can.
